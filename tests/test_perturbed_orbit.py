    ## Environment setup
    Letâ€™s create the environment for our simulation. This setup covers the creation of (celestial) bodies, vehicle(s), and environment interfaces.

    For more information on how to create and customize settings, see the [user guide on how to create bodies](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup.html#body-creation-procedure).

    ### Create the bodies
    **Celestial** bodies can be created by making a list of strings with the bodies that is to be included in the simulation.

    For the most common celestial bodies in our Solar system, default settings (such as atmosphere, body shape, rotation model) come predefined in Tudat.
    See the [user guide on default environment models](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup.html#body-creation-procedure) for a comprehensive list of default models.

    These settings can be adjusted. Please refer to the [Available Environment Models](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/environment_models.html#available-model-types) in the user guide for more details.
